            Not all classrooms have four walls - and not all college experiences need to be at a college!

There are many different ways you can spend a gap year - there is no formula, and YOU are in charge of your year. A gap year can include many different elements, from working, interning, volunteering and studying abroad. 
<ul>

    <li> For earning money, you can stay local or find a job outside your hometown-
         there are many options, which this website page will not focus on. 
         Specifically, this page will provide you with information on studying 
         abroad and taking a gap year. 
    </li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
    Taking a gap year or traveling during college is an academic endeavor that can add perspective,
    challenge, and insight into any area of study. There are many programs out there to structure and
    guide your journeys, so that you can make the very most out of your time abroad. Whether you are 
    interested in language, religion, politics, or environmentalism; there is a program out there for
    you! I encourage you to think big and chase your dreams❤

    <h3>Consider the Investment</h3>
    <p> 
    Depending on what you do, a Gap Year can be a significant investment, but is well worth the cost. 
    Investing in a Gap Year allows you to start college with greater focus and a stronger idea of what 
    you want to achieve. This can help you connect your studies to potential career paths. Studies have 
    found that students who take a Gap Year typically graduate in four years compared to the five year 
    average, with higher GPAs than their peers, and 84% of students reported being satisfied with their 
    careers. Discuss a budget with your family, start researching grants and financial aid, and think
    about getting a job now to save up in advance.
    Many people are discouraged from studying abroad because of the myth that travel is too expensive. However, there are numerous ways to find funding!

  <h3>○ PRO TIP</h3>
  <p>
    Think of the qualities that make you unique as you search for scholarships - it
    will help you find unique opportunities that won’t come up in a general search! There
    are scholarships out there for all layers of diversity including what specific region you
    plan to study in as well as what specific topics/languages you might study while abroad.
    (For example, this list of scholarships for LGBTQ+ students). Other ideas include: 
  </p>
  <ol>
    <li>Start a travel registry on fundraising sites ( <a href="https://www.gofundme.com/">Go Fund Me </a> , <a href="https://www.fundmytravel.com/"> Fund My Travel</a> , <a href="http://razoo.com/"> Razoo </a></a>) </li>
  
  <li>Request a donation around holidays, your birthday, and before you leave </li>
  <li>Consider finding part-time work  </li>
  <li>Contact Civic Groups, like the local  <a href="https://www.rotary.org/en">Rotary </a> , or <a href="https://www.lionsclubs.org/en"> Lions Clubs </a> </li>
  <li>Ask your family, friends, neighbors, and social media community to help contribute money!</li>
  <li>There are many scholarships designed specifically to help you - Research scholarships as early as possible - do not wait until you have been accepted to a program! There are some national scholarships with great odds, but may only have deadlines once or twice a year. </li>
</ol>

<p>If you decide that a gap year is NOT right for you, that is perfectly ok! I applaud you for knowing yourself and what you want to get out of college. Many people thrive the best in a traditional college setting - and that is great. If you decide that you don't want to take a gap year, but would like to study abroad for a shorter period of time in college, here are a few suggestions: </p>
